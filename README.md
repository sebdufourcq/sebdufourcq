<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Sebastien</h1>

<h3 align="center">A passionate Cyber Security Service Delivery Manager from France</h3>

## Description
In the early 2000s, I had a subscription to *Hackerz Voice* and then *The Hackademy Journal*.  
At the age of 13, I discovered Unix, telnet, cross site scripting, buffer overflow, phishing,...  
I was fascinated but the technical level was way above my skills.  
I've left most of it behind me for many years.
From industrial project management, to digital transformation and finally cyber security, I'm back in the game.
