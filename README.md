### Hi there, I'm Sebastien 👋

## 🛡️ I'm a cyber security Service Delivery Manager.

## Description
In the early 2000s, I had a subscription to *Hackerz Voice* and then *The Hackademy Journal*.  
At the age of 13, I discovered Unix, telnet, cross site scripting, buffer overflow, phishing,...  
I was fascinated but the technical level was way above my level.  
I've left it behind me for more than 20 years...
